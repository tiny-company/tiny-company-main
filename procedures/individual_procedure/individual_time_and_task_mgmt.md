# Individual task and time management

## Description

Find in this document all procedures related to the personal time and task management (how to organize, plan).

### Organize

One of the best method in order to organize tasks is [GTD](https://asana.com/resources/getting-things-done-gtd).
Let's take an example during the [pre-work session](../individual_procedure/individual_work_session/individual_work_session_method.md#phase-1--pre-work-session) while prepare working day planning, we have several new tasks or ideas to plan. Using the GTD method, we can organize them like so :
- 1. Capture : let's write all tasks/feature, ideas in order to free the mind.
- 2. Clarify : let's add more details to each tasks (description, link to project, add time estimation, budget, priority).
- 3. Organize : Add tasks/ideas to associated project in backlog.
- 4. Reflect : (Re)-prioritize tasks as today's need.
- 5. Engage : Do what was previously planned.

### Set priority and deadline

During the task definition and priorization, it is important to be able to define the right priority and associate deadline to tasks.
One of the reason to define deadline is [Parkinson law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) : "Work expands to fill the available time"
