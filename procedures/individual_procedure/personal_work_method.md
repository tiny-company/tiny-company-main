### Work Organization

- Start work day :

#### Phase 1 : pre-work session

During this phase, that occured before the stand up meeting, we do not start active work session (main reason : time available not long enough between start work and stand up meeting).
Instead we enter in the "work session mind process" progressively by :
- Checking email
- Checking monitoring system (if enough time, fix issue)
- Preparing stand up meeting by :
    - overview of task achieved previously (retrospective).
    - task currently working on.
    - task planned this day.
    - any new information (i.e : from email or monitoring)
- Doing IT overwatch

#### Phase 2 : morning work session
