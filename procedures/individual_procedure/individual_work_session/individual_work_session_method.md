# Individual work method

## Description

Find in this document indiviual/personal work methods in order to improve work organization in a day. <br>
This guide is based on multiple work methods, see [Sources](#sources) to learn more. <br>

This guide present a classic office day, which contain :
- 1 work session in the morning.
- 2 to 4 work session in the afternoon.

### Phase 1 : Pre-work session

During this phase, that occured before the stand up meeting, do not start active work session (main reason : time available is not long enough betyouen start work moment and stand up meeting start).
Instead enter in the "work session mind process" (which prepare the brain to be aware of the work to do for the day) progressively by :
- Checking email.
- Checking monitoring system (if enough time, fix issue).
- Preparing stand up meeting by :
    - overview of task achieved previously (retrospective).
    - task currently working on.
    - task planned this day.
    - any new information (i.e : from email or monitoring).
    - update or add new tasks / subtasks.
- Prepare working day planning by applying '[time boxing](https://asana.com/resources/what-is-timeboxing)' method and modelize it through [Time and task tracking tool](https://super-productivity.com/) :
    - If any new tasks have to be planned (taken from the sprint backlog), follow the [individual time and task management guide](../individual_time_and_task_mgmt.md).
    - If existing tasks, then re-adjust estimated time depending on the progress. (if you realize that you will need more or less time to finish the task).

> Note : Once this step done, the work day planning should be clear and easy to expose during the stand-up meeting. It also help to free mental space by suppressing cognitive load.

### Phase 2 : Stand-up meeting

Stand up meeting with team, in order to discuss and exchange about current work (15 min) :
- Shortly (5 minutes) describes what was achieved previously (if new), what currently working on (task, feature), if any obstacle is faced.
- Re-organize task priority if needed.
- Adress new topics, share information.
- plan additional meeting in the morning to manage certain issue (meeting to resolve issue, manage urgent subject).

### Phase 3 : Morning work session

Usually after standup meeting, if no additional meeting is planned, you can prepare morning session (according to the time lasting before lunch).
> Reminder : Tools used to track time and task progress is [SuperProductivity](https://super-productivity.com/)

Open work sesion app (super-productivity), choose task to work on and start work session depending on your personal pomodoro parameters (default 45 minutes).
The working session end at lunch time.

### Phase 4 : Afternoon work session 1

#### 4.1  Mentalize (3 min)

Mentalize afternoon planning (3 min) :
- mental planning of the working sessions conduct
    - how many (2 to 3 work session)
    - what about (what to do during these session)
    - how long (45 min to 2h session)

> This step help the awareness of what will happen in the next hours and prevent procrastination.

#### 4.2  Focus exercice (15 min)

After lunch, it is usually more difficult to be immediatly focus, to fix this prepare by doing focus exercises (estimated duration : 10-15 minutes), see below exercises examples :
- keyboard training : https://www.keybr.com/
- breathing exercises (Inhale for a count of 5 seconds, and then exhale for another 5 seconds)
- reading technical documentation

#### 4.3  Work session

After focus exercises, start the work session with Task tracking tool. <br>

In [SuperProductivity](https://super-productivity.com/), there is two type of working session :
- [Pomodoro](https://asana.com/resources/pomodoro-technique) : A time limited session that can be paused at any time.
- Focus : a limited time session that cannot be paused.

Some recommendation about work session :
- Dedicate a specific workspace that gather the tools needed for the work session (avoid distraction from other tasks).
- Don't listen to music while working as it reduce focus precision or consider playing background or ambient sounds, such as instrumental music or white noise.
- If the work ambiant noise is to loud (like open-space) use noise-cancelling headphones to block out distractions.
- Surround yourself with positive stimuli (objects) that can enhance focus and creativity.

#### 4.4 Pause

Once the work is done, or if the  pomodoro work session duration end, make a pause. Depending on your focus level, you can either skip the pause or make a short pause (15 min), see below pause's activities :
- hydratation
- coffee
- reading
- sport exercises
- stretching
- music listening
- video watching
- keyboard training : https://www.keybr.com/
- chess game : https://www.chess.com/play/computer
- memory game : https://pairs.one/fr/games/4db839c07681?mode=solo

After the pause, restart the cycle from the step 4.2 or 4.3 depending on your focus level.
